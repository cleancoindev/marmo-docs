# What is Marmo?

Marmo is an open-source SDK that simplifies interactions with the Ethereum network by abstracting some of its core characteristics while maintaining trustlessness and security. Its features include gas-less transactions for integrated Ethereum wallets, automatic handling of Gas Price and Gas Limits calculations, nonce-flexible transactions with any number of dependencies -including zero- and transactions with expirations dates, which will always get executed within a predefined time frame.

Marmo works with every existing type of smart contract, allowing a fast and seamless integration with any project on the Ethereum ecosystem.
